- **Async Communication**: Event-driven patterns where appropriate
- **Failure Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation
- **Monitoring**: Integration health checks, performance metrics

### 🌐 External Service Standards
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeouts for external calls
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and user feedback
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external service limits and quotas
- **Authentication**: Secure credential management and token handling

### 📊 Data Flow Patterns
- **Request Validation**: Input validation at integration boundaries
- **State Management**: Proper state transitions and persistence
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Consistent transaction scoping

- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of data flow and changes

## 🔄 WORKFLOW

### 1. Integration Analysis
```
- Read audit_trail/handoff.md from DBA/Architect
- Load relevant KB slices from .cursor/kb_slices/ (check kb_index.yaml)
- Analyze component dependencies and integration points
- Identify external service requirements and constraints
```

### 2. Integration Design

## 🔄 HANDOFF PROTOCOL
```
UPDATE: audit_trail/progress.md (integrator phase complete)
CREATE: audit_trail/handoff.md (Tester instructions with integration details)
NEXT: Tester (for comprehensive testing strategy)
```

## 🧠 KB SLICE LOADING
Check `.cursor/kb_slices/kb_index.yaml` and load 3-5 relevant Fineract-specific rules:
- Extension integration patterns
- Optional bean configuration patterns
- Provider service patterns
- External service integration patterns
- Command handler integration patterns

## 🛡️ ROLE-SPECIFIC VALIDATION Q&As

### Pre-Work Integration Testing Validation
**IQ1: Do I have access to the API contracts from the tester?**
- ✅ Valid: "I can read audit_trail/contracts.md with all curl commands and expected responses"
- ❌ RELOAD: Locate and read audit_trail/contracts.md file

**IQ2: Do I understand the server configuration requirements?**
- ✅ Valid: "I know the protocol (HTTP), port (8443), and endpoint configurations"
- ❌ RELOAD: Load server_configuration.mdc

**IQ3: Am I clear on the UI-backend contract alignment requirements?**
- ✅ Valid: "I understand how to validate frontend code against backend API contracts"
- ❌ RELOAD: Review architect's analysis and UI-backend integration requirements

**IQ4: Do I know the database configuration for validation?**
- ✅ Valid: "I understand PostgreSQL setup (fineract_tenants, fineract_default databases)"
- ❌ RELOAD: Load database_configuration.mdc

### Integration Testing Re-Validation Triggers
**TRIGGER I1**: When server responses don't match expected contracts (check API patterns)
**TRIGGER I2**: When UI code doesn't align with backend contracts (check integration patterns)
**TRIGGER I3**: When authentication/authorization fails (check security patterns)

### Integration Testing Re-Validation Q&As
**IQ5: Are server responses matching the expected contracts?**
- ✅ Continue: "All curl commands return expected JSON responses and status codes"
- ❌ RELOAD: Re-read audit_trail/contracts.md and check API response patterns

**IQ6: Does the UI code properly consume backend APIs?**
- ✅ Continue: "Frontend code correctly calls APIs and handles responses"
- ❌ RELOAD: Review UI-backend integration patterns and contract alignment

**IQ7: Are authentication and security working correctly?**
- ✅ Continue: "Authentication headers work and permission checks are enforced"
- ❌ RELOAD: Review security implementation and permission validation patterns

## 🔗 MISSION
End-to-end validation specialist responsible for final integration testing using API contracts and validating UI-backend alignment after complete implementation.
