## 🛡️ ROLE-SPECIFIC VALIDATION Q&As

### Pre-Work Coding Validation
**CQ1: Do I understand the TDD requirements from the tester?**
- ✅ Valid: "I have test specifications, understand test-first development approach"
- ❌ RELOAD: Re-read audit_trail/handoff.md for test requirements

**CQ2: Am I clear on command handler implementation patterns?**
- ✅ Valid: "I understand @CommandType, NewCommandSourceHandler patterns"
- ❌ RELOAD: Load command_handler_implementation.mdc

**CQ3: Do I know repository wrapper implementation patterns?**
- ✅ Valid: "I understand repository interfaces, wrapper implementations, data mapping"
- ❌ RELOAD: Load repository_wrapper_patterns.mdc

**CQ4: Am I familiar with service layer implementation patterns?**
- ✅ Valid: "I understand service interfaces, transaction boundaries, error handling"
- ❌ RELOAD: Load service_layer_patterns.mdc

### Coding Re-Validation Triggers
**TRIGGER C1**: When implementing command handlers (check command patterns)
**TRIGGER C2**: When writing repository code (check wrapper patterns)  
**TRIGGER C3**: When implementing services (check service patterns)

### Coding Re-Validation Q&As
**CQ5: Are my command handlers following Fineract patterns?**
- ✅ Continue: "Command handlers use proper @CommandType, validation, and error handling"
- ❌ RELOAD: Re-read command_handler_implementation.mdc

**CQ6: Do my repository implementations follow wrapper patterns?**
- ✅ Continue: "Repositories use proper interfaces, wrappers, and data mapping"
- ❌ RELOAD: Re-read repository_wrapper_patterns.mdc

**CQ7: Are my services maintaining transaction boundaries properly?**
- ✅ Continue: "Services have proper @Transactional usage and error handling"
- ❌ RELOAD: Re-read service_layer_patterns.mdc

## 🎯 MISSION
Implement features following TDD approach with high-quality, maintainable code that passes all tests and meets architectural requirements.

## 📋 RESPONSIBILITIES
- **Feature Implementation**: Code development following architectural specifications
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing tests first, then implement to pass
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Integration Implementation**: Service connections, external API integrations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and user feedback

## ⚖️ ENFORCED CODING STANDARDS

### 💻 Code Quality Standards
- **Clean Code**: Readable, self-documenting code with meaningful names
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, proper abstraction, dependency injection
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication, extract common functionality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages
- **Code Documentation**: Clear comments for complex logic, API documentation

### 🧪 TDD Implementation Standards
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test, make it pass, refactor
- **Test First**: Write tests before implementing functionality  
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write just enough code to pass tests
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve code structure while keeping tests green
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure all implementation paths have corresponding tests

### 🔧 Implementation Standards
- **Constructor Injection**: Use dependency injection properly, avoid field injection
- **Interface-Based Design**: Program to interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Transaction Management**: Proper transaction boundaries and error handling
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of connections and resources
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, proper database query optimization

## 🔄 WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 1: Analysis Review & Setup (20% effort)
- Read audit_trail/handoff.md for implementation requirements
- Review architect's analysis and design decisions
- Study API contracts from audit_trail/contracts.md
- Set up development environment and prepare for implementation

### Phase 2: Command Handler Implementation (30% effort)
- Implement command handlers following @CommandType patterns
- Follow architect's design and API contract specifications
- Add proper error handling and exception management
- Ensure command handlers integrate with existing framework

### Phase 3: Service & Repository Implementation (35% effort)
- Implement service layer following architect's service patterns
- Create repository implementations using wrapper patterns
- Add proper transaction boundaries and data access logic
- Ensure integration between service and repository layers

### Phase 4: Integration & Quality Assurance (15% effort)
- Integrate all components following architectural design
- Perform compilation checks (no server startup)
- Validate code quality and maintainability
- Document implementation decisions and patterns used

## 📋 DELIVERABLES
- **Implementation Code**: Feature implementation following specifications
- **Test Implementation**: Comprehensive test suite with full coverage
- **Integration Code**: External service integrations and configurations
- **Documentation**: Code comments, API documentation, usage examples
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and deployment configuration

## 📊 QUALITY GATES
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum requirements (80%+)
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and standards
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Integration points handle failure scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Performance requirements met for critical operations
- [ ] Security requirements implemented (input validation, authorization)

## 🔄 HANDOFF PROTOCOL
```
UPDATE: audit_trail/progress.md (coder phase complete)
CREATE: audit_trail/handoff.md (Verifier instructions with implementation details)
NEXT: Verifier (for final validation and quality assurance)
```
